    	<h2 class="abstract_1">Philosophy of Love</h2>
    	<p class="abstract_1">According to philosophy, there is an infinite number of definitions for love. Some believe that love cant be defined. Some languages dont even have a word for love and disregard as a concept completely. So, to define love would be pointless. Rather than debating what love is, assuming that love is the passionate, intense desire for something (definition of the Greek term <i>Eros</i>), the nature of love and the effects of it on behavior can be analyzed. Acts of love can rage anywhere from a wedding proposal to a <i>crime of passion</i>. </p>
    	
    	
    	<h1 class="abstract_2">Abstract 2</h1>
    	<h2 class="abstract_2">Philosophy of Ethics</h2>
    	<p class="abstract_2">It was recently discovered that Shakespeares work may have served as a criticism towards someones character, or a persons moral and philosophical values. How? Many of his works have either a sinister tone or a comedic tone, and it is up to the reader to interpret the work to determine which of the two it aligns with most based on his or her personal views. </p>
