    <!-- Definition of philosophy -->
    <h1 class="definition">Definition of Philosophy</h1>
    <p class="definition">The study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- Abstract 1 -->
    <h1 class="abstract_1">Abstract 1</h1>
    <h2 class="abstract_1">Philosophy of Love</h2>
    <p class="abstract_1">According to philosophy, there is an infinite number of definitions for love. Some believe that love cant be defined. Some languages dont even have a word for love and disregard as a concept completely. So, to define love would be pointless. Rather than debating what love is, assuming that love is the passionate, intense desire for something (definition of the Greek term <i>Eros</i>), the nature of love and the effects of it on behavior can be analyzed. Acts of love can rage anywhere from a wedding proposal to a <i>crime of passion</i>. </p>
    <br>
    <!-- Abstract 2 -->
    <h1 class="abstract_2">Abstract 2</h1>
    <h2 class="abstract_2">Philosophy of Ethics</h2>
    <p class="abstract_2">It was recently discovered that Shakespeares work may have served as a criticism towards someones character, or a persons moral and philosophical values. How? Many of his works have either a sinister tone or a comedic tone, and it is up to the reader to interpret the work to determine which of the two it aligns with most based on his or her personal views. </p>
    <br>
    <!-- Abstract 3 -->
    <h1 class="abstract_3">Abstract 3</h1>
    <h2 class="abstract_3">Philosophy of Epistemology</h2>
    <p class="abstract_3">Epistemology is the study of knowledge. When using this lens its understanding how the knowledge of something, or a lack thereof, can make an impact in a story. Therefore youre able to define what is a belief, the justification of your belief, and what is the truth within a piece of literature. When broken down, a reader can see what knowledge may be a broad agreement, evidence of a belief, or certainty of a belief, helping the reader come to a conclusion on the differences between a belief and the truth. </p>
    <br>
    <!-- Discussion questions -->
    <h1 class="discussion">Discussion</h1>
    
    <h2 class="discussion">Bloom Taxonomy</h2>
    <a href="https://www.edline.net/files/_YSGo2_/a6ad2bf58764aff03745a49013852ec4/Blooms_Taxonomy_questions.pdf" class="discussion">Here is the link to help you.</a>

    <h2 class="discussion">Questions</h2>
    <p>Are there any other times during the play where dramatic irony is applied? If so, what are they and in what ways does it relate to the example used earlier?</p>
    <p>Do you think there are similarities between the three examples we gave for each philosophies, if so what?</p>
